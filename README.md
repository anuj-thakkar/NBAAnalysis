# NBA Analytics Report

During the first outbreak of COVID-19 in March 2020, one of the worldâ€™s favorite leagues, the National Basketball Association (NBA), was forced to halt all league games until further notice. Few months down the road, the NBA approved a competitive format for the comeback of the 2019-20 season with 22 teams returning to play in Orlando, Florida. Of course, with the new and improved format of the season, with an exclusion of 8 teams in the remainder of the season, some teams may or may have performed differently, which is why I chose to explore and analyze consistent and structured datasets from the regular season and the NBA Restart.

Converted these data to a .csv to import into my R studio.

## Project Structure

This project is structured into two main parts.

Part 1 consists of the motive of the project and the initial exploration of the data.

Part 2 covers three of the research questions that back up the main goal of this analytics project.
